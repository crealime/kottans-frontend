## Git Basics

### Introduction to Git and GitHub
- I've used Git before, but only commands like clone, pull, push, commit. Branches and their merging were new to me.
- I was surprised that it is not so difficult as it seemed.
- I'll definitely use separate branches to develop new features

### Linux Survival
- Until that time, I used a minimum of commands in the terminal (cd, mkdir, ls). Everything else was new and interesting for me.
- To be honest, I did not want to use the terminal in my work, because I thought it would be hard to remember all the commands. It turned out that there are not so many basic commands, and it is not difficult to remember them.
- I'll try to use all of this commands in my work. Maybe I even install Linux or rent a server for practice.

### HTTP Protocol
- I already knew most of the information about HTTP. Reading articles allowed to structure it.
- I was surprised how many headers are used to communicate between server and client.
- I'll read more about headers and try to use them.

### Intro to HTML & CSS | Learn HTML | Learn CSS
- I already knew these technologies at this level. But I repeated everything with pleasure.
- I was surprised that the html tag has position relative as default (although it is logical). I thought that all elements have a static position by default.

- I repeated the basics of JavaScript with pleasure. It was new for me: `import * as` `prop in object` `str.endsWith()` `str.repeat()`.
- I was surprised that I didn't know a great service freeCodeCamp.
- It's still not clear to me how closures can be used in real practice. But I hope to use it soon.
